# Project Name

I have created a chatbot that will match you to a marine animal based on a few personality traits. 

## The problem

I tried to make the basic functions work first, creating buttons and eventhandlers. 
Tools: everything I could find - google, teammates, friends. 
I sketched out the whole idea first on paper and then made it work in code. 
I would add sounds and maybe a picture per creature next.
